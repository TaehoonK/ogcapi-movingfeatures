== Abstract Test Suite
=== Introduction
The Abstract Test Suite (ATS) presented in this Annex is a compendium of test assertions applicable to implementations of the OGC API - Moving Features - Part 1: Core Standard. An ATS provides a basis for developing an Executable Test Suite to verify that the implementation under test conforms to all the relevant functional specifications.

The abstract test cases (assertions) are organized into test groups that correspond to distinct conformance classes defined in the OGC API - Moving Features - Part 1: Core Standard.

Implementations of OGC API Standards are not Web Services in the traditional sense. Rather, they define the behavior and content of a set of Resources exposed through a Web Application Programming Interface (Web API). Therefore, an API may expose resources in addition to those defined by the standard. A test engine shall traverse the API, identify and validate test points, and ignore resource paths which are not to be tested.

The Conformance Classes addressed by this Abstract Test Suite are the:

* <<clause-conf-collection, MovingFeature Collection Catalog Conformance Class>>
* <<clause-conf-movingfeature, MovingFeature Conformance Class>>
