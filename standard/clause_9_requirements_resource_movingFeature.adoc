=== Resource MovingFeature
==== Overview
A *MovingFeature* object consists of the set of static information that describes a single moving feature and the set of temporal object, such as temporal geometry and temporal properties.
An abbreviated copy of this information is returned for each *MovingFeature* in the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items` GET response.

<<moving-feature-properties-table>> defines the set of properties that may be used to describe a moving feature.
The schema for the moving feature object presented in this clause is an extension of the *_GeoJSON Feature Object_* defined in link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON].
By default, the properties defined in <<moving-feature-properties-table>> are the same as the link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-045r3/19-045r3.html#mfeature[*_MovingFeature Object_* in OGC MF-JSON].
The semantics of each property are also the same as those defined in MF-JSON.

However, depending on where this schema is used (i.e., depending on which resource produces results with which query parameter), there are differences in requirements from the schema defined in MF-JSON;
as sometimes it only needs to have static information, and sometimes it also has a *temporalGeometry*.
For example, in MF-JSON, `type` and `temporalGeometry` are mandatory, but in this API, `id` and `type` are mandatory. This is why the defined schema is represented in GeoJSON, not MF-JSON.

NOTE: The properties _id_, _type_, _geometry_, _properties_, and _bbox_ were inherited from link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.2[GeoJSON].

NOTE: The properties *time*, *crs*, *trs*, *temporalGeometry*, and *temporalProperties* were inherited from link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-045r3/19-045r3.html#mfeature[OGC MF-JSON]

==== Operation
//TODO: Why Replace operation is not supported
===== Retrieve
The retrieve operation is defined in the `Feature` conformance class of OGC API — Features.
No modifications are needed to support <<resource-movingfeature-section,*MovingFeature*>> resources.

. Issue a `GET` request on the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}` path

[[movingfeature-identifier]]
The `{mFeatureId}` path parameter is the unique identifier for a single moving feature offered by the API.
The list of valid values for `{mFeatureId}` is provided in the <<resource-movingfeatures-section,`{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items`>> GET response.

Support for GET on the `{root}/collections/{collectionID}/items/{mFeatureId}` path is required by OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/movingfeature/REQ_operation-movingfeature-get.adoc[]

===== Delete
The delete operation is defined in the `link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#delete[DELETE]` conformance class of OGC API — Features.

. Issue a `DELETE` request on `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}` path

Support for the HTTP DELETE method is required by OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/movingfeature/REQ_operation-movingfeature-delete.adoc[]

==== Response
===== Retrieve
A successful response to the *MovingFeature* GET operation is a set of metadata that describes the moving feature identified by the <<movingfeature-identifier,`{mFeatureId}`>> parameter.
This response does not include a set of temporal object information.
The temporal object information may be accessed using  <<resource-temporalGeometrySequence-section,*TemporalGeometry*>> and <<resource-temporalProperties-section,*TemporalProperties*>> operations.

The `time` property of the *MovingFeature* response represents a particular period of moving feature existence.

===== Delete
A successful response to the *Collection* DELETE operation is an HTTP status code.

==== Error situations
General guidance on HTTP status codes and how they should be handled is provided in <<http-status-codes>>.
