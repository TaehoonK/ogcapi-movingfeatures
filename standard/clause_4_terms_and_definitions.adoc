== Terms and definitions

=== application programming interface (API)
an interface that is defined in terms of a set of functions and procedures, and enables a program to gain access to facilities within an application +

=== coordinate
one of a sequence of numbers designating the position of a point +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: In a spatial coordinate reference system, the coordinate values are qualified by units.# +
 [source: ISO 19111]

=== coordinate reference system (CRS)
coordinate system that is related to an object by a datum +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: Geodetic and vertical datums are referred to as reference frames.# +
[small]#Note 2 to entry: For geodetic and vertical reference frames, the object will be the Earth.
In planetary applications, geodetic and vertical reference frames may be applied to other celestial bodies.# +

=== dataset
collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats +

=== datatype
specification of a value domain with operations allowed on values in this domain +
[small]#Examples: `Integer`, `Real`, `Boolean`, `String` and `Date`.# +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: Data types include primitive predefined types and user definable types.# +
 [source: ISO 19103]

=== distribution
represents an accessible form of a dataset +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: EXAMPLE: a downloadable file, an RSS feed or a web service that provides the data.# +

=== dynamic attribute
characteristic of a feature in which its value varies with time +

=== feature
abstraction of a real-world phenomena +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: A feature can occur as a type or an instance.
Feature type or feature instance should be used when only one is meant.# +
 [source: ISO 19109]

=== feature attribute
characteristic of a feature +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: A feature attribute can occur as a type or an instance.
Feature attribute type or feature attribute instance is used when only one is meant.# +

=== feature table
table where the columns represent feature attributes, and the rows represent features +
 [source: OGC 06-104r4]

=== geographic feature
representation of real-world phenomenon associated with a location relative to the Earth +
 [source: ISO 19101-2]

=== geometric object
spatial object representing a geometric set +
 [source: ISO 19107:2003]

=== leaf
<one parameter set of geometries> +
geometry at a particular value of the parameter +
 [source: ISO 19141]

=== moving feature
feature whose position changes over time +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: Its base representation uses a local origin and local coordinate vectors of a geometric object at a given reference time. [source: ISO 19141]# +
[small]#Note 2 to entry: The local origin and ordinate vectors establish an engineering coordinate reference system (ISO 19111), also called a local frame or a local Euclidean coordinate system.[source: ISO 19141]# +

=== property
facet or attribute of an object referenced by a name +
 [source: ISO 19143]

=== resource
entity that might be identified +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: The term “resource”, when used in the context of an OGC Web API standard, should be understood to mean a <<web-resource, web resource>> unless otherwise indicated.# +

=== resource type
a type of resource +
[small]#Note 1 to entry: Resource types are re-usable components that are independent of where the resource resides in the API.# +
