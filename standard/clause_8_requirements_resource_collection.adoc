=== Resource Collection
==== Overview
A *Collection* information object is the set of metadata that describes a single collection.
An abbreviated copy of this information is returned for each *Collection* in the `{root}/collections` GET response.

The schema for the collection information object presented in this clause is an extension of the collection schema defined in link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#collection-description[OGC API — Common] and link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#\_collection\_[OGC API — Features].

<<collection-properties-table>> defines the set of properties that may be used to describe a collection.

[cols="25,10,65",options="header"]
|===
|Property           |Requirement |Description
|_id_               |M |A unique identifier of the collection.
|_title_            |O |A human-readable name given to the collection.
|_description_      |O |A free-text description of the collection.
|_links_            |M |A list of links for navigating the API (e.g. link to previous or next pages; links to alternative representations, etc.)
|_extent_           |O |The spatiotemporal coverage of the collection.
|*_itemType_*       |M |Fixed to the value "movingfeature".
|*_updateFrequency_*  |O |A time interval of sampling location. The time unit of this property is millisecond.
|===

NOTE: The _id_, _title_, _description_, _links_, _extent_, and _itemType_ properties were inherited from link:https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#collection-description[OGC API — Common] and link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#_collections_[OGC API — Features].

NOTE: An update frequency is one of the most important properties of a moving feature collection.
The update frequency can be used to handle the continuity of the moving feature's trajectory.

==== Operation
===== Retrieve
The retrieve operation is defined in the OGC API — Common `https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#collection-description[Collection]` conformance class.
No modifications are required to support *MovingFeature* resources.

. Issue a `GET` request on the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}` path

[[collection-identifier]]
The `{collectionId}` path parameter is the unique identifier for a single collection offered by an API implementation instance.
The list of valid values for `{collectionId}` is provided in the <<resource-collections-section,`/collections`>> response.

Support for the `{root}/collections/{collectionId}` path is required by OGC API — Common.

include::requirements/collection_catalog/collection/REQ_operation-collection-get.adoc[]

===== Replace
The replace operation is defined in the `link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#replace[REPLACE]` section of the "Create/Replace/Delete" requirements class of OGC API — Features.
This operation targets the <<resource-collection-section,*Collection*>> resource.

. Issue a `PUT` request on `{root}/collections/{collectionId}` path

Support for the HTTP PUT method is specified as a requirement in OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/collection_catalog/collection/REQ_operation-collection-put.adoc[]

NOTE: Once set, the update frequency cannot be changed.

The following example replaces the feature created by the <<collections-post-example,Create Example>> with a new feature (collection metadata without an update frequency).
Once again, the replacement feature is represented as a JSON payload.
A pseudo-sequence diagram notation is used to illustrate the details of the HTTP communication between the client and the server.

include::examples/collection-put.adoc[]

===== Delete
The delete operation is defined in the `link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#delete[DELETE]` section of the "Create/Replace/Delete" requirements class of OGC API — Features.

. Issue a `DELETE` request on `{root}/collections/{collectionId}` path

Support for the HTTP DELETE method is specified as a requirement in OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/collection_catalog/collection/REQ_operation-collection-delete.adoc[]

The following example deletes the feature created by the <<collections-post-example,Create Example>> and replaced with a new feature in the <<collections-put-example,Replace Example>>.
A pseudo-sequence diagram notation is used to illustrate the details of the HTTP communication between the client and the server.

==== Response
===== Retrieve
A successful response to the *Collection* GET operation is a set of metadata that describes the collection identified by the <<collection-identifier,`{collectionId}`>> parameter.

===== Replace
A successful response to the *Collection* PUT operation is an HTTP status code.

===== Delete
A successful response to the *Collection* DELETE operation is an HTTP status code.

==== Error situations
General guidance on HTTP status codes and how they should be handled is provided in <<http-status-codes>>.
