=== Resource TemporalPrimitiveGeometry
==== Overview
[[temporalPrimitiveGeometry-object]]
A *TemporalPrimitiveGeometry* resource represents the movement of a moving feature with various types of moving geometry, i.e., `MovingPoint`, `MovingLineString`, `MovingPolygon`, and `MovingPointCloud`.
It can also represent the movement of a 3D object with its orientation.

The schema for the *TemporalPrimitiveGeometry* presented in this clause is the same as the link:https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/19-045r3/19-045r3.html#tprimitive[*_TemporalPrimitiveGeometry_*] object defined in <<OGC_19-045r3,MF-JSON>>.
<<temporalPrimitiveGeometry-properties-table>> defines the set of properties that may be used to describe a *TemporalPrimitiveGeometry*.

|===
|Property       |Requirement    |Description
|*_id_*                 |M  |A unique identifier to the temporal primitive geometry.
|*_type_*               |M  |A primitive geometry type of MF-JSON (i.e., one of 'MovingPoint', 'MovingLineString', 'MovingPolygon', or 'MovingPointCloud').
|*_datetimes_*          |M  |A sequence of monotonically increasing instants.
|*_coordinates_*        |M  |A sequence of leaf geometries of a temporal geometry, having the same number of elements as "datetimes".
|*_interpolation_*      |M  |A predefined type of motion curve (i.e., one of 'Discrete', 'Step', 'Linear', 'Quadratic' or 'Cubic').
.2+.^|*_base_*
.2+.^|O  |*_type_*: A type of 3D file format, such as 'STL', 'OBJ', 'PLY', and 'glTF'.
         |*_href_*: A URL to address 3D model data which represents a base geometry of a 3D shape.
.2+.^|*_orientations_*
.2+.^|O  |*_scales_*: An array value of numbers along the x, y, and z axis in order as three scale factors.
         |*_angles_*: An array value of numbers along the x, y, and z axis in order as Euler angles in degree.

==== Operation
===== Delete
The delete operation is defined in the `link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html#delete[DELETE]` conformance class of API — Features.

. Issue a `DELETE` request on `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}/tgsequence/{tGeometryId}` path

[[tpgeometry-identifier]]
The {tGeometryId} parameter is the unique identifier for a single temporal primitive geometry object offered by the API.
The list of valid values for `{tGeometryId}` is provided in the <<resource-temporalGeometrySequence-section,`{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items/{mFeatureId}/tgsequence`>> GET response.

Support for the HTTP DELETE method is specified as a requirement in OGC API — Features.

include::requirements/movingfeature/tpgeometry/REQ_operation-tpgeometry-delete.adoc[]

==== Response
===== Delete
A successful response to the *TemporalPrimitiveGeometry* DELETE operation is an HTTP status code.

include::requirements/movingfeature/tpgeometry/REQ_response-tpgeometry-delete.adoc[]

==== Error situations
General guidance on HTTP status codes and how they should be handled is provided in <<http-status-codes>>.
