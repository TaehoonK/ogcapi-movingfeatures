[[resource-service-catalog]]
== Requirement Class "Service Catalog"
The catalog is a hierarchy that demonstrates how resources and operations are related to one another in the services portion of the OGC API — MF.

In this concept, the operations are split into three groups P1, P2, P3. The rational is to split the development of the standard into three incremental phases corresponding to these groups. 

.P1: Retrieval of features and their attribute
These operations retrieve positions, trajectories, and velocities of a moving feature such as a car, a person, a vessel, an aircraft, and a hurricane. Mainly P1 covers the operations in MF-Access, and their temporal counterparts.   

.P2: Topological operations/predicates between pairs of features, where at least one is a moving feature.
These operations perform, for instance, an “intersection” between a geometry object like an administrative boundary and a trajectory of a moving feature like a car, a person, a vessel, an aircraft, and a hurricane. Also, this category includes the operations of WKT and WKB, which require as a pre-requisite to develop these representation standards.

.P3: Advanced aggregation and analytical operations
An example of these operations is to calculate a distance of the nearest approach of a
trajectory to another trajectory. Case studies include calculating the distance between
a criminal agent and a police agent for predicting crime patterns or the distance
between soccer players for making proper tactics.

=== Resource Duration
==== Methods
. Issue a `GET` request on the `{root}/services/SpatiotemporalProcessing/Accessor/duration` path

==== Description

Return a time interval - without gaps - starting with the smallest timestamp till the largest time stamp during which the moving feature was defined.

==== Request parameters

* TemporalGeometry or TemporalProperty: given as literal in the request, as file, or as a query

Example:
`{root}/services/SpatiotemporalProcessing/Accessor/temporal_duration?{root}/collections/{collectionId} /items/{mFeatureId}/tgeometry /{tGeometryId}/{queryType}`

====  Error situations
General guidance on HTTP status codes and how they should be handled is provided in <<http-status-codes>>.
