|Requirement    |
<<req_mf_leaf-parameter-definition, /req/movingfeatures/param-leaf-definition>> +
<<req_mf_leaf-parameter-response, /req/movingfeatures/param-leaf-response>>
|Test purpose   | Validate that the `leaf` query parameter is processed correctly.
|Test method    |
DO FOR each Resource which have `datetimes` property:

1. Calculate a temporal geometry coordinate (or temporal property value) with the *_pointAtTime_* query at each time included in the `leaf` parameter, using interpolated trajectory according to the `interpolation` property +
2. Verify that the temporal geometry coordinate (or temporal property value) intersects the interpolated trajectory according to the `interpolation` property, using datetime value defined by the `leaf` parameter
