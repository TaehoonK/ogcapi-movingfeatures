|*Abstract Test {counter:conf-id}* |*/conf/movingfeatures/features-get*
|Requirement    |
<<req_mf-features-op-get, /req/movingfeatures/features-get>> +
<<req_mf-features-response-get, /ref/movingfeatures/features-get-success>>
|Test purpose   | Validate that *MovingFeatures* can be identified and extracted from a *MovingFeature Collection* using query parameters.
|Test method    |
For every *MovingFeature Collection* identified in *MovingFeature Collections*, issue an HTTP GET request to the URL `+{root}+/collections/+{collectionId}+/items` where `+{collectionId}+` is the id property for a *MovingFeature Collection* described in the *MovingFeature Collections* content

1. Validate that a document was returned with a status code `200` +
2. Validate the contents of the returned document using test <<conf_mf_features_get_success, `/conf/movingfeatures/features-get-success`>>

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests that defined in the OGC API — Common: +
- Bounding Box: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_bounding_box_tests[Bounding Box Tests] +
- Limit: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_limit_tests[Limit Tests] +
- Date-Time: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_date_time_tests[Date-Time Tests]

Execute requests with combinations of the `"bbox"` and `"datetime"` query parameters and verify that only features are returned that match both selection criteria.
