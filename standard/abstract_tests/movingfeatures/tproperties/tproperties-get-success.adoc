|*Abstract Test {counter:conf-id}* |*/conf/movingfeatures/tproperties-get-success*
|Requirement    | <<req_mf-tproperties-response-get, /req/movingfeatures/tproperties-get-success>>
|Test purpose   | Validate that the *TemporalProperties* complies with the required structure and contents.
|Test method    |
1. Validate the *TemporalProperties* property is present and that it is populated with an array of <<tproperty-schema, TemporalProperty>> items +
2. Validate that the `name` and `type` property is present +
3. Validate that the `type` property is present and its value is one of the predefined values (i.e., one of 'TBoolean', 'TText', 'TInteger', 'TReal', and 'TImage') +
4. If the `links` property is present, validate that all entries comply with OGC API — Features link:https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#ats_core_fc-links[/conf/core/fc-links] +
5. If the `timeStamp` property is present, validate that it complies with OGC API — Features link:https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#ats_core_fc-timeStamp[/conf/core/fc-timeStamp] +
6. If the `numberMatched` property is present, validate that it complies with OGC API — Features link:https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#ats_core_fc-numberMatched[/conf/core/fc-numberMatched] +
7. If the `numberReturned` property is present, validate that it complies with OGC API — Features link:https://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r4/17-069r4.html#ats_core_fc-numberReturned[/conf/core/fc-numberReturned] +
8. Validate the *TemporalProperties* resource for all supported media types using the resources and tests identified in <<temporalproperties-schema>>
