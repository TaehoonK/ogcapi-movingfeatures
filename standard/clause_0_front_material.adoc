== Abstract

Moving feature data can represent various phenomena, including vehicles, people, animals, weather patterns, etc.
The OGC API — Moving Features (OGC API — MF) is a Draft Standard defining a standard interface for querying and accessing geospatial data that changes over time, such as the location and attributes of moving objects like vehicles, vessels, or pedestrians.
The OGC API — MF provides a standard way to manage these data, which can be helpful for applications such as transportation management, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
OGC API — MF also includes operations for filtering, sorting, and aggregating moving feature data based on location, time, and other properties.

The OGC API — Moving Features — Part 1: Core specifies a set of RESTful web service interfaces and data formats for querying and updating moving feature data over the web.
<<OGC-API,OGC API Standards>> define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way.
<<OPENAPI,OpenAPI>> is used to define the reusable API building blocks with responses in JSON and HTML.

The OGC API family of standards is organized by resource type.

== Security considerations

The OGC API — Moving Features — Part 1: Core Draft Standard does not mandate any specific security controls.
However, it was constructed to add security controls without impacting conformance, the same as the link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html#_91afaabd-dc29-41eb-805d-15e1afd18825[OGC API — Common — Part 1: Core].

This document applied the Requirement link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html#rc_oas30-security[/req/oas30/security] for OpenAPI 3.0 Security support.
